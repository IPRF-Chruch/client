            Pastoral couple Pastor Reinhard Yan and Joyce Lakawa are the lead
            shepherds of IPRF Minnesota Church. This ministry has been pioneered
            by them since the year 2000. IPRF Minnesota primarily consists of
            Indonesian congregants residing in Minnesota. The church is
            officially registered as a non-profit organization under the
            category of “Church” with the State of Minnesota and holds an
            Article of Incorporation issued by the Secretary of State. Pastor
            Reinhard Yan Lakawa completed a Diploma in Theology from STT - SATI
            (Trinity Bible Seminary of Indonesia) and earned his Bachelor&apos;s
            degree from STT Inalta in 1991. He is currently pursuing his
            Master&apos;s in Theology in the United States. Prior to pioneering
            IPRF in Minnesota, Pastor Reinhard ministered in various regions in
            Indonesia including Lawang (East Java), Kupang (East Nusa Tenggara),
            and Jakarta, and also served in churches in Los Angeles and New
            Jersey. Pastor Joyce Lakawa-Mailoor graduated from Beiji Bible
            School in Batu, Malang, and previously assisted in ministry at GPdI
            Nyiur Melambai, Tanjung Priok, Jakarta. The couple was united in
            holy matrimony in 1997. Following their marriage, God gave them the
            vision to plant a church in Minnesota. This location came to their
            attention by what seemed like coincidence—Minnesota being in the
            center of the U.S. map caught Pastor Reinhard’s eyes, and they began
            to pray fervently for it. What began as a small seed in prayer
            became a firm calling from God. Pastor Reinhard initially aspired to
            join the military, following in his brother’s footsteps. However,
            his encounter with a team of theology students from STT SATI in his
            hometown in Central Sulawesi redirected his path. The words of
            Pastor Joshua from Singapore, who led the team, echoed in his heart:
            “The fields are ripe for harvest.” It was the beginning of God’s
            calling in his life while still in high school. Pastor Joyce also
            had a life-changing calling from God. As a child, she often battled
            illnesses and even had a critical hospitalization. After her
            miraculous recovery, she dedicated her life to serve God. Though she
            had initially dreamed of becoming a doctor and was offered
            guaranteed admission (PMDK) to the University of Indonesia and Sam
            Ratulangi University, she instead chose to attend Bible school to
            prepare for full-time ministry. They both went through various
            challenges and sacrifices, but they believed in the living God who
            called them and remained faithful to His promise to be with His
            people—our Lord Jesus Christ. Pastor Reinhard once said he is
            grateful for the hardships he went through, as they shaped him into
            the servant of God he is today. One such testimony is when he had no
            financial support for his theological education. A church elder in
            his village donated a sack of unhusked rice (a tithe offering from
            their small congregation), which was sold to fund the trip from
            Central Sulawesi to East Java. Although the money only covered
            travel costs, God miraculously provided all his needs through to the
            completion of his diploma and bachelor&apos;s degree.

            Before arriving in Minnesota, the couple received an invitation to
            pastor a church in West Palm Beach, Florida. Life in Florida was
            “comfortable”—the ministry was well-established, their living needs
            were met, and even the church members planned to buy them a house.
            Yet, God&apos;s vision for Minnesota remained strong in their
            hearts. They agreed to minister in Florida for three months only, as
            previously committed. Two Indonesians living in Minnesota were
            contacted before their move. Their reactions were mixed—just like
            the biblical contrast between Joshua & Caleb and the other ten
            spies. One warned that Minnesota was a dull and desolate place,
            while the other, Mr. Daud Sumihi, received them joyfully and
            eventually became the church&apos;s first member. Their journey to
            Minnesota wasn&apos;t easy. They drove a 1990 Mazda MX-6, carrying
            only $300 in cash. Their car was old and unreliable, and many were
            worried it wouldn&apos;t make the long journey. But just like the
            Israelites whose sandals did not wear out in the wilderness, the
            couple&apos;s car endured the 3-day journey across multiple
            states—fully loaded with their belongings stacked even on the car
            roof. They arrived in Minnesota in November 2000. Their first
            challenge was finding a place to live with limited funds. They
            applied for an apartment, but approval typically took several days.
            Desperate, they pleaded with the manager to call the property owner.
            While waiting, they prayed under a tree in the apartment complex. A
            few hours later, they were miraculously approved. The apartment they
            received was located just beside the tree where they had prayed.
            When Pastor Joyce saw it, she immediately knelt in gratitude. The
            apartment manager, deeply moved by their story, called it a
            miracle—something she had never experienced before. With God&apos;s
            provision, their ministry began the following Sunday. The first
            service was just the two of them—Pastor Reinhard preached and Pastor
            Joyce led worship. The following week, Mr. Daud Sumihi joined, then
            brought three friends. They bought ten chairs and prayed over the
            empty ones every week. God continued to send more people, and soon
            the apartment could no longer hold the congregation. They then
            approached Assembly of God Church near their apartment. On the first
            visit, Pastor Larry Freitag declined their request. But they
            continued to pray. On the second visit—this time together—Pastor
            Larry welcomed them warmly. He shared that God had spoken to him the
            night before, saying that a couple would come asking for help, and
            he was to support them in every way. Through God&apos;s grace, IPRF
            Minnesota was allowed to use that church building from 2000 to 2010.
            Today, IPRF Minnesota continues to experience God&apos;s
            faithfulness and now holds services at:
